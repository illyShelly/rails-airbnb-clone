# 1. I want to create new Booking, no edit, update => make sence to know if I want to book or not when paying. Otherwise owner could have lost.
# 2. no possibility to delete or change, could show with payment method?? or direct redirection to payment gate...
# 3. on dashboard -> later created, see all bookings and all my own flats
# 4. see status -> confirm by owner (accept or decline)

# a) booking related to flat and current signin user
# b) when submit booking -> redirect to all my bookings
# c) owner cannot book his own flat
# d) check if flat is not booked already for particular time
# e) accept or decline -> method
